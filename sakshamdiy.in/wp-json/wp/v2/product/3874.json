The main frame is glass fiber while the arms are constructed from ultra durable polyamide nylon, this version 3 of the q450 features integrated pcb connections for direct soldering of your escs. This eliminates the need for a power distribution board or messy multi-connectors keeping your electronics layout very tidy. V3 also comes with stronger molded arms over v1 and v2, so no more arm breakage at the motor mount on a hard landing, assembly is a breeze with pre-threaded brass sleeves for all of the frame bolts, so no lock-nuts are required. It utilizes one size of bolt for the entire build, making the hardware very easy to keep in order and only requiring one size of hex wrench to assemble, a great feature of this frame is the large mounting tabs at the front and rear of the mainframe bottom plate for mounting cameras or other accessories. This makes for a great way to take aerial video or fly fpv without the need to add any additional mounting brackets, specs: , width: 450mm, height: 55mm, weight: 270g (w or out electronics), motor mount bolt holes: 16 or 19mm.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Built from quality glass fiber and polyamide-nylon<\/p>\n<p>Pre-threaded brass sleeves for all of the frame bolts<\/p>\n<p>Integrated PCB connections for direct soldering of your ESCs<\/p>\n<p>Colored arms for orientation to keep you flying in the right direction<\/p>\n<p>Size (L x W x H): 21.4 Cm, 11.5 Cm, 9.2 Cm<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":3875,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"product_cat":[312],"product_tag":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/sakshamdiy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product\/3874"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/sakshamdiy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/sakshamdiy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/product"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sakshamdiy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3874"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sakshamdiy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3875"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/sakshamdiy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3874"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"product_cat","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sakshamdiy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat?post=3874"},{"taxonomy":"product_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sakshamdiy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_tag?post=3874"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
