					<description><![CDATA[When using a drone, a transmitter is one of the most important components. You can’t fly a multirotor without it because it uses radio signals to send commands wirelessly to a Radio Receiver, which is connected to an aircraft or multirotor that is being remotely controlled.

This is the FlySky FS-i6 2.4G 6CH PPM RC Transmitter With FS-iA6B Receiver. It is a great entry-level radio for those just starting in the field of drones flying.

Above all, you get a slim, modern radio transmitter that fits nicely in your hands and weighs just under 400 gm. It won’t test your arm stamina on those long flights. This radio is also really practical with a 3-position switch. It has two adjustable knobs for flight modes/ multiple flap positions.

You will get the new FS-iA6B receiver with this kit. This is a compact 6-channel receiver with a range exceeding 500m in addition. it comes with a dual antenna for excellent reception and interference rejection capabilities.

Each transmitter has a unique ID and so when binding; the receiver remembers this ID and accepts data from that transmitter only. This avoids picking up other transmitter signals and dramatically decreases inference and increases safety.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Works in the frequency range of 2.405 to 2.475GHz.This band has been divided into 142 independent channels,each radio system uses 16 different channels and 160 different types of hopping algorithm.</p>
<p>This radio system uses low power electronic components and sensitive receiver chip.The RF modulation uses intermittent signal thus reducing even more power consumption.</p>
<p>AFHDS2A system has the automatic identification function,which can switch automatically current mode between single-way communication mode and two-way communication mode according to the customer needs.</p>
