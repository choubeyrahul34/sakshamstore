										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Breadboard Product Details: You just. plug-in vertically your components in the position you want without soldering. The projectboard will accept up, clock-clips, the smaller DIP&#8217;s. Each unit will accept transistors, diodes, LEDS, resistors, capacitors, pots and virtually all types of components. The units are desired to use #22-30 solid hookup wire foe interconnection will plug-in ease. it could be combined with a series features a unique interlocking desired, without tools to meet changing requirements and components are reuseful. A breadboard is used to make up temporary circuits for testing or to try out an idea. No soldering is required so it is easy to change connections and replace components. Parts will not be damaged so they will be available for re-use afterwards. Features: 100% Brand New &amp; High Quality! 840 Tie points 128 Groups of 5 connected terminals 8 Bus of 25 connected terminals Size 175 x 67 x 8mm (Products can be spliced together in the same specification) Reusable for fast build a prototype of an electronic circuit Each unit will accept transistors, diodes, LEDS, resistors, capacitors and virtually all types of components No soldering required Can modify or revise the circuits easily Similar prototyping printed circuit boards An invaluable tool for experimenting with circuit designs whether in the R&amp;D or university lab Adhesive sheet on the back side of the board. Fit for jumper wire of 0.8mm diameter. Standard 2.54mm hole spacing Excellent quality breadboard. ABS plastic material. Completely reusable. Light weight, easy to carry. Easy to use</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Solderless Breadboard: A breadboard is used to make up temporary circuits for testing or to try out an idea. This mini solderless breadboards have 3M double sided sticky tape on the back to mount them on to any circuit board of your choice. It comes with markings for easy circuit building and debugging. It can be used in a small working area for compact circuits. It can be used for prototyping, testing and creating add-on modules or new circuits. 400 tie-point 2 Power Lanes, Tie-point 100 1 Double-strip, Tie-point 300 SIZE: 8.2 5.5 0.85CM Specification:- 1.Perfect for Arduino Shield Prototyping and Testing; 2.
